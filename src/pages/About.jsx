        <p>
          At <strong>Xyonica</strong>, we know the real thrill of RC isn't perfection - 
          it's that heart-pounding moment when you <strong>push limits</strong> 
          and learn something new (usually after a crash).
        </p>
        <ul className="hobby-features">
          <li>Forgiving controls that help you recover from "creative" flying</li>
          <li>Easy-to-repair designs because we know crashes happen</li>
          <li>Affordable replacement parts so the fun never stops</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Because the best pilots aren't those who never crash - 
          they're the ones having the most fun getting back in the air.
